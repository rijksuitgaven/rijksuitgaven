## User Research Gaps

**What we don't know yet:**

- [ ] Detailed job-to-be-done per segment
- [ ] Willingness to pay by segment
- [ ] Feature priority by segment

## Discussion Points

1. **Priority segments:** Focus on opposition + journalists first?
2. **Government market:** Large opportunity but long sales cycles?
3. **Compliance market (V6):** Separate go-to-market needed?
4. **Academic discount:** Worth the lower revenue?
5. **International (V7):** Partner-led or direct?
