# Marketing

All marketing-related content for Rijksuitgaven.

## Structure

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `newsletters/` | Email newsletters (named `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`) |

## Tone of Voice

- Formal Dutch: always "u", never "je/jij"
- Factual: every claim must be verifiable against production
- No superlatives without evidence (e.g., "50x sneller" backed by actual measurements)
- See `02-requirements/brand-identity.md` for full brand guidelines
