### 1. Apparaat Typesense Search Decision (Brainstorm)

Resolved pending decision on whether/how to include Apparaat in global search.

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Include in global search? | Yes - mixed results with other modules |
| Primary search field | `kostensoort` (weight: 100) |
| Secondary search field | `begrotingsnaam` (weight: 50) |
| First table column | Kostensoort (replaces Ontvanger) |
| Expandable row grouping | User chooses: Begrotingsnaam (default), Artikel, Detail |

**Key insight:** Apparaat works exactly like other modules, just with Kostensoort instead of Ontvanger. Same DataTable component, same patterns.
