## Work Completed

### UX-010: Google Search Link for Recipients
- Added "Zoek op Google" external link icon next to every recipient name in main table
- **Design iterations:**
  1. First placed in expanded row header → moved to main table for visibility
  2. Used native `title` tooltip → switched to CSS instant tooltip
  3. Used `data-tooltip` (wrapping) → created `data-tooltip-center` (single-line, centered)
- **Final implementation:**
  - Small ExternalLink icon (14px) next to recipient name
  - Always visible (not just on hover)
  - Navy medium color → pink on hover
  - Centered tooltip "Zoek op Google" appears instantly above icon
- **New CSS class:** `[data-tooltip-center]` for compact, centered tooltips on icons

### Overzichtspagina Decision: Deferred to V5
- Analyzed WordPress detail page vs V1 expanded row
- **Conclusion:** V1 expanded row covers functional need
- Full "Recipient Profile Panel" deferred to V5 (AI Research Mode) where it becomes essential
- Panel will provide context for AI analysis and "Add to Dossier" (V6) functionality
- Documented in backlog with version mapping (V5=HIGH, V6=HIGH, V8=CRITICAL)
