# Daily Log — 2026-02-28

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V2.0 Development
**Sprint:** Week 9+ — Pre-Launch Polish & Beta Feedback
**Session Duration:** ~5h (4 sessions)

---

## Summary

Massive bug-fix day + infrastructure simplification across 4 sessions. Session 1: production fixes (word boundary, NULLS LAST, back button, version renumber, test framework 32/32, login email). Session 2: deep TanStack Table pin/expand debugging (6 root causes). Session 3: eliminated staging environment entirely — localhost now works as full dev/test environment (added RESEND_API_KEY + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .env.local), deleted staging branch + Railway service, simplified CLAUDE.md deployment protocol from 146 to 56 lines. Session 4: comprehensive staging reference cleanup — removed dead URLs from ALLOWED_HOSTS, updated 3 architecture/deployment docs, committed previously uncommitted work (email subjects, V5 concepts, web archives, lighthouse reports), removed .DS_Store from tracking. UX-039/041 preserved on `feature/ux-039-041` branch. 24 commits total.

## Work Completed

1. **Bug Fix: Autocomplete click returns 0 results (V2.3.1)** — Two bugs found and fixed:
   - `is_word_boundary_match()` failed on terms with special chars (parentheses, hyphens) — adaptive `\b` boundaries
   - `has_primary_query` gate was False in regex fallback path — added `using_regex_fallback` flag
2. **Test Framework: curl-based API integration tests** — Built `scripts/tests/` with:
   - `lib.sh` — shared helpers (colors, assertions, fetch with BFF auth)
   - `smoke.sh` — post-deploy health verification (~15s)
   - `regression.sh` — 6 regression tests for known bugs (REG-001 through REG-006)
   - `run.sh` — entry point (`./run.sh smoke|regression|all`)
   - `README.md` — strategy, decision tree for when to run what
3. **Bug Fix: sort_by=primary desc fails on NULL rows** — PostgreSQL puts NULLs first with DESC ordering; Pydantic `primary_value: str` rejected None → 400 error. Fixed by adding `NULLS LAST` to all 3 sort clause locations in modules.py. Verified across all 6 modules.
4. **Version Renumbering: V2.0.1–V2.0.3 → V2.1–V2.3** — These were features/improvements, not patches. Updated VERSIONING.md (full renumber cascade), release-notes.ts (banner data), versiegeschiedenis page (changelog). Downstream V2.x versions renumbered accordingly.
5. **Bug Fix: Browser back button broken** — `router.replace()` in module-page.tsx overwrote browser history on every filter change. Fixed with debounced `router.push()` (500ms) + duplicate URL skip. Staging merge conflict resolved (combined with UX-039/UX-041 features).
6. **Copy: Login email session duration info** — Added "Na inloggen blijft u ingelogd zolang u het platform minstens één keer per 7 dagen bezoekt." to magic link login email (both HTML and plain-text versions). Matches text already present in invitation email.
7. **Bug Fix: UX-039 Row Pinning — 10 staging commits** — Comprehensive fix session for pin/unpin/expand on staging:
   - **Unpin during search:** `row.pin(false)` → direct `setRowPinning` state update
   - **Phantom rows:** `dataIdSet` filter on `getCenterRows()` removes rows kept by `keepPinnedRows`
   - **Stale closure:** `pinnedCount` missing from `columns` useMemo dependency array
   - **Expand broken (parseInt):** `onExpandedChange` used `parseInt(k, 10)` on string primary_value IDs → NaN → silent fail
   - **Auto-expand key:** Used numeric index instead of `primary_value` string as expanded state key
   - **Data-change wipe:** `setExpanded({})` on data change destroyed pinned row expanded state. Now preserves pinned rows.
   - **Pinned rows disappear during search:** Server-side pagination means TanStack loses pinned rows not in search results. Added `pinnedRowsCache` (Map<string, RecipientRow>) that stores row data when pinned.
   - **Expand click area:** Chevron button was only 4px padding, rest of cell was dead space
   - **Chevron hidden behind primary column:** Expand column 32px but two buttons need ~48px. Primary column (sticky, z-10, left:32px) overlapped the chevron. Added `STICKY_PRIMARY_OFFSET_PINNED_PX = 56` for pinned rows.
   - **Chevron hover invisible:** Changed to always-pink chevron on pinned rows + `blue-100` hover bg
   - **Pink border on expanded content:** Added `isPinned` prop through renderExpandedRow → ExpandedRow, applied `border-l-2 border-l-[var(--pink)]` to all 5 `<tr>` elements
   - **Max pinned rows:** Increased from 4 to 5
8. **Infrastructure: Eliminate staging environment (Session 3)** — Cost/complexity analysis showed localhost is better for solo founder:
   - Fixed localhost login: added `RESEND_API_KEY` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `app/.env.local`
   - Created `feature/ux-039-041` branch to preserve UX-039/UX-041 code
   - Deleted `staging` branch (local + remote)
   - Deleted staging Railway service (~€5-10/month saved)
   - Simplified CLAUDE.md: replaced 146-line staging protocol with 56-line feature branch workflow
   - Updated memory files (removed staging deploy commands)
   - New workflow: feature branches + localhost testing, hotfixes straight to main
9. **Cleanup: Remove all staging references (Session 4)** — Comprehensive audit found 5 stale staging references:
   - Removed dead staging Railway URL from ALLOWED_HOSTS in magic-link and invite routes
   - Updated git strategy diagram in RECOMMENDED-TECH-STACK.md (feature branches, no staging)
   - Updated deployment-strategy.md (localhost replaces staging setup)
   - Updated test README example to use localhost instead of staging URL
   - Committed previously uncommitted work: onboarding email subjects, V5 concepts 7-9, web archives, lighthouse reports
   - Removed .DS_Store files from git tracking

2. **Homepage copy optimization** — Remaining value props with "doel door doen" pattern
3. **M1.0 Launch Gate items** — SEO, DNS plan, rate limiting, user migration
4. **CRM Phase 3** — Drop redundant subscription columns
