# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V1.0 Development
**Sprint:** Week 7 — Pre-Launch Tasks
**Sessions:** 3 (continued from prior day's H2 prototype work)

---

## Summary

Completed Phase 2 of the Homepage H2 "Probeer het zelf" live search widget. The H2 prototype (56 curated hardcoded rows with client-side filter) was upgraded to search against 463,731 recipients via a public API endpoint with anti-scraping measures. Diagnosed and fixed two issues: (1) backend not deployed yet caused "Geen resultaten" on all queries, (2) word-boundary filter blocked type-ahead prefix matching (e.g., "deve" → no results for "Deventer"). Both fixes deployed and verified on production. Followed by copy polish session with expert team review — refined subheadline, source attribution, trust bar, and CTA text.

## Work Completed

### Session 1: Phase 2 Deploy + Test
- [x] Reviewed Phase 2 implementation state (all 4 files from prior session)
- [x] Diagnosed "Geen resultaten" for "deventer" — `.env.local` points BFF to production backend, which didn't have the new endpoint yet
- [x] Started local backend, verified endpoint works (10 results for "deventer")
- [x] Tested multiple queries locally: deventer (10), prorail (2), universiteit (10), am (4)
- [x] Committed and pushed: `2899a35` — 6 files, 1338 insertions, 687 deletions

### Session 2: Type-ahead Fix
- [x] User reported "deve" returns no results (word-boundary filter requires complete words)
- [x] Verified Typesense prefix search correctly returns 307 results for "deve"
- [x] Removed `is_word_boundary_match` filter from `public.py` — Typesense prefix search already handles partial queries
- [x] Removed unused `re` import
- [x] Verified on production: "deve" returns 10 results (gemeente Deventer first), "pro" works, "deventer" works
- [x] Committed and pushed: `dad3cf7`

### Session 3: Copy Polish
- [x] Expert team review of subheadline — "6 databronnen" not clear as benefit
- [x] Audited all 6 modules to understand actual data scope (instrumenten, apparaat, inkoop, provincie, gemeente, publiek)
- [x] Key insight: COA data via WOO verzoek = not voluntarily public, so "openbare overheidsdata" is inaccurate
- [x] Subheadline: "Een professioneel abonnement..." → "Overheidsuitgaven op één plek — doorzoekbaar in seconden"
- [x] Source attribution: "Bron: data.overheid.nl" → "Bronnen: Rijksoverheid & medeoverheden"
- [x] Trust bar: 463.731 → 450.000+ (future-proof, doesn't go stale)
- [x] CTA: "Bekijk alle jaren" → "Bekijk alle jaren en data" (broader scope)
- [x] Committed and pushed: `2a72b9e`

## Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `backend/app/api/v1/public.py` | Public search endpoint — Typesense → universal_search SQL, returns ontvanger/y2024/totaal only |
| `app/src/app/api/v1/public/search/route.ts` | BFF proxy with token bucket rate limiter (20 burst, 5/min, fingerprint + query cost) |
| `docs/plans/2026-02-17-homepage-h2-probeer-het-zelf.md` | Full design spec for H2 widget (layout, table, search architecture, anti-scraping) |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/src/app/h2/page.tsx` | Phase 2: API integration, loading skeletons, rate limit/empty states + copy polish (subheadline, source, trust bar, CTA) |
| `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` | Register public router at `/public` prefix |
| `backend/app/api/v1/public.py` | Removed word-boundary filter for type-ahead support |
| `backend/app/main.py` | Exclude `/api/v1/public/search` from BFF secret middleware |
| `docs/plans/2026-02-17-homepage-h2-probeer-het-zelf.md` | Updated copy decisions (source, CTA) |

## Issues Resolved

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| All searches return "Geen resultaten" | Backend changes not deployed — committed and pushed to trigger Railway deploy |
| "deve" returns no results (type-ahead broken) | Removed `is_word_boundary_match` filter — Typesense prefix search already handles partial queries |

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Remove word-boundary filter | Yes | Typesense prefix search is the right mechanism for type-ahead; word-boundary requires complete words |
| Deploy without local BFF test | Yes | Backend verified locally, BFF code is straightforward proxy, production test confirms |
| Source attribution | "Bronnen: Rijksoverheid & medeoverheden" | COA data via WOO = not voluntarily public, so "openbare" is inaccurate |
| Subheadline | "Overheidsuitgaven op één plek — doorzoekbaar in seconden" | Benefit-first, no feature jargon ("6 databronnen"), nothing excluded |
| Trust bar number | 450.000+ | Future-proof, doesn't go stale when count changes |

## Next Steps

1. **Homepage integration** — embed H2 widget (and H1/H3) into redesigned `public-homepage.tsx`
2. **CRM Phase 3** — drop redundant columns from subscriptions
3. **Search enhancements** — multi-word AND, exact phrase, prefix
4. **User migration** — ~50 WordPress users to import
5. **V1 Feature Close Review** — backlog + sprint verification

**Session Status:** Complete — 4 commits, 4 pushes, all verified on production
