# Daily Log — 2026-02-27

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V2.0 Development
**Sprint:** Week 9+ — Pre-Launch Polish & Beta Feedback
**Session Duration:** ~5h (3 sessions)

---

## Summary

Session 1: UI copy improvements across 6 files (homepage, column headers, menu, search placeholders, number formatting, pluralization). Deployed to both environments.

Session 2: Major data accuracy bug fix — search-scoped results. When searching "deltares", RVO appeared with full €1.8B total instead of just the Deltares-related portion (~€122M). Implemented hybrid query routing: primary name matches use fast aggregated view, secondary field matches use filtered source table. Also scoped expanded rows to respect search terms and active filters.

Session 3: Two critical hotfixes for the search-scoped results deploy. (1) Pydantic model missing `is_secondary_match` field — silently stripped from API response, frontend never received the flag, expanded rows never scoped. (2) `primary_only_keys` not initialized at top scope — only defined inside `if search:` block, caused NameError on every default browse (no search), breaking all 6 module pages. Both fixed and deployed. Full verification: 17/17 test suite passed, key design doc scenarios confirmed.

## Work Completed

### UI Text Changes (Session 1)
- "rijksoverheidsuitgaven" → "overheidsbestedingen" on homepage
- "Ook in" → "Komt ook voor in" column header (4 files)
- "biljoen" → always "miljard" in amount formatting
- "Zoek in alle" → "Doorzoek ontvangers" menu item
- "Zoek in" → "Doorzoek" for integraal search placeholder
- "+X meer" → "+X resultaat/resultaten" (singular/plural)

### Search-Scoped Results Bug Fix (Session 2)
- **Change 1 (Backend):** Split `_get_from_aggregated_view()` into primary/secondary query paths. Secondary matches query source table with search filter. Parallel execution via `asyncio.gather`. Python-side merge with relevance sorting and pagination.
- **Change 2 (Backend):** Added `search` + `filter_fields` params to `get_row_details()` and API endpoint. Extracts filter params from `Request.query_params`.
- **Change 3 (Frontend):** Thread `searchQuery` to `ExpandedRow` for secondary match scoping.
- **Change 4 (Frontend):** Thread `activeFilters` to `ExpandedRow` for filter-scoped expansion.
- **Edge case fix:** Added `is_secondary_match` flag to distinguish secondary matches from enriched primary matches (both can have `matchedField` after enrichment).
- **Edge case fix:** `has_primary_query` correctly skips aggregated view when all matches are secondary.
- **Edge case fix:** Year/amount filters applied to secondary results in Python.
- Design document: `docs/plans/2026-02-27-search-scoped-results.md`

### Hotfixes (Session 3)
- **Hotfix 1:** Added `is_secondary_match: Optional[bool] = None` to Pydantic `AggregatedRow` model in `backend/app/api/v1/modules.py`. Without this, Pydantic silently stripped the field from API responses — frontend condition `row.isSecondaryMatch && searchQuery` always evaluated false.
- **Hotfix 2:** Initialized `primary_only_keys: list[str] = []` at function scope in `backend/app/services/modules.py`. Variable was only defined inside `if search:` block but referenced unconditionally at `has_primary_query` check — caused NameError on every non-search page load, breaking all 6 modules.
- **Verification:** 17/17 cross-module tests passed (autocomplete, browse, search). Key scenarios confirmed: deltares→RVO shows €2.4M (not €1.8B), expanded rows scoped correctly, all modules browse normally, totals match row sums.

## Issues Resolved

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| RVO shows €1.8B when searching "deltares" instead of ~€122M | Hybrid query routing: secondary matches use source table with search filter |
| Expanded rows show ALL detail rows ignoring search/filter scope | Pass `?q=` and filter params to detail API endpoint |
| Primary matches with enriched matchedField incorrectly treated as secondary | Added `is_secondary_match` boolean flag to API response |
| All-secondary search (no primary name matches) runs unnecessary aggregated view query | Fixed `has_primary_query = bool(primary_only_keys) or not search` |
| Pydantic silently stripping `is_secondary_match` from API response | Added field to `AggregatedRow` Pydantic model |
| Default browse (no search) returns NameError on all modules | Initialized `primary_only_keys = []` at function scope |

## Next Steps

- Continue with remaining beta polish items
- Test remaining edge case scenarios from design doc (combined search + filter, cross-module counts)
