# Daily Log — 2026-02-27

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V2.0 Development
**Sprint:** Week 9+ — Pre-Launch Polish & Beta Feedback
**Session Duration:** ~7h (5 sessions)

---

## Summary

Session 1: UI copy improvements across 6 files (homepage, column headers, menu, search placeholders, number formatting, pluralization). Deployed to both environments.

Session 2: Major data accuracy bug fix — search-scoped results. When searching "deltares", RVO appeared with full €1.8B total instead of just the Deltares-related portion (~€122M). Implemented hybrid query routing: primary name matches use fast aggregated view, secondary field matches use filtered source table. Also scoped expanded rows to respect search terms and active filters.

Session 3: Two critical hotfixes for the search-scoped results deploy. (1) Pydantic model missing `is_secondary_match` field — silently stripped from API response, frontend never received the flag, expanded rows never scoped. (2) `primary_only_keys` not initialized at top scope — only defined inside `if search:` block, caused NameError on every default browse (no search), breaking all 6 module pages. Both fixed and deployed. Full verification: 17/17 test suite passed, key design doc scenarios confirmed.

Session 4: Feedback button dynamically positions above cookie banner. Users who don't dismiss the cookie bar couldn't see the Feedback button (both fixed to bottom of viewport). Feedback button now checks localStorage for banner state and adjusts offset. Smooth slide-down animation when banner is dismissed via custom event.

Session 5: Google search icon UX overhaul in data table. Replaced generic ExternalLink icon with branded navy Google "G" SVG. Iterative /frontend-design review: tightened chevron-to-name spacing (expand column 40→32px), made G icon smaller (12px) and hidden by default (opacity-0, appears on row hover at 60%, full on direct hover). Eliminated visual clutter while keeping functionality accessible.

## Work Completed

### UI Text Changes (Session 1)
- "rijksoverheidsuitgaven" → "overheidsbestedingen" on homepage
- "Ook in" → "Komt ook voor in" column header (4 files)
- "biljoen" → always "miljard" in amount formatting
- "Zoek in alle" → "Doorzoek ontvangers" menu item
- "Zoek in" → "Doorzoek" for integraal search placeholder
- "+X meer" → "+X resultaat/resultaten" (singular/plural)

### Search-Scoped Results Bug Fix (Session 2)
- **Change 1 (Backend):** Split `_get_from_aggregated_view()` into primary/secondary query paths. Secondary matches query source table with search filter. Parallel execution via `asyncio.gather`. Python-side merge with relevance sorting and pagination.
- **Change 2 (Backend):** Added `search` + `filter_fields` params to `get_row_details()` and API endpoint. Extracts filter params from `Request.query_params`.
- **Change 3 (Frontend):** Thread `searchQuery` to `ExpandedRow` for secondary match scoping.
- **Change 4 (Frontend):** Thread `activeFilters` to `ExpandedRow` for filter-scoped expansion.
- **Edge case fix:** Added `is_secondary_match` flag to distinguish secondary matches from enriched primary matches (both can have `matchedField` after enrichment).
- **Edge case fix:** `has_primary_query` correctly skips aggregated view when all matches are secondary.
- **Edge case fix:** Year/amount filters applied to secondary results in Python.
- Design document: `docs/plans/2026-02-27-search-scoped-results.md`

### Hotfixes (Session 3)
- **Hotfix 1:** Added `is_secondary_match: Optional[bool] = None` to Pydantic `AggregatedRow` model in `backend/app/api/v1/modules.py`. Without this, Pydantic silently stripped the field from API responses — frontend condition `row.isSecondaryMatch && searchQuery` always evaluated false.
- **Hotfix 2:** Initialized `primary_only_keys: list[str] = []` at function scope in `backend/app/services/modules.py`. Variable was only defined inside `if search:` block but referenced unconditionally at `has_primary_query` check — caused NameError on every non-search page load, breaking all 6 modules.
- **Verification:** 17/17 cross-module tests passed (autocomplete, browse, search). Key scenarios confirmed: deltares→RVO shows €2.4M (not €1.8B), expanded rows scoped correctly, all modules browse normally, totals match row sums.

### Feedback Button + Cookie Banner (Session 4)
- Cookie banner dispatches `cookie-banner-change` custom event on dismiss
- Feedback button checks `localStorage('cookie-banner-dismissed')` on mount + listens for event
- Dynamic bottom offset: `bottom-16` (banner visible) → `bottom-5` (dismissed), with `transition-all duration-300`
- Form/success panels also adjust: `bottom-[7.5rem]` → `bottom-20`

### Google Search Icon UX (Session 5)
- Replaced generic `ExternalLink` (lucide-react) with branded navy Google "G" SVG icon
- Removed underline from recipient name to separate the two interactive elements
- Added hover state to expand chevron (`group/expand` for pink color on hover)
- Iterative `/frontend-design` review identified 3 refinements:
  1. **Tighter spacing:** Expand column 40→32px, cell padding `px-3`→`px-1` on expand column
  2. **Smaller G icon:** `h-3.5 w-3.5` → `h-3 w-3` (14px→12px)
  3. **Hidden by default:** `opacity-0`, appears `group-hover:opacity-60` on row hover, `hover:!opacity-100` on direct hover
- `STICKY_PRIMARY_OFFSET_PX` constant updated 40→32, totals row uses dynamic constant instead of hardcoded value
- Staging merge: resolved conflict with UX-039 pin code, applied `px-1` fix to both pinned and unpinned row renderers

## Issues Resolved

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| RVO shows €1.8B when searching "deltares" instead of ~€122M | Hybrid query routing: secondary matches use source table with search filter |
| Expanded rows show ALL detail rows ignoring search/filter scope | Pass `?q=` and filter params to detail API endpoint |
| Primary matches with enriched matchedField incorrectly treated as secondary | Added `is_secondary_match` boolean flag to API response |
| All-secondary search (no primary name matches) runs unnecessary aggregated view query | Fixed `has_primary_query = bool(primary_only_keys) or not search` |
| Pydantic silently stripping `is_secondary_match` from API response | Added field to `AggregatedRow` Pydantic model |
| Default browse (no search) returns NameError on all modules | Initialized `primary_only_keys = []` at function scope |
| Feedback button hidden behind cookie banner for users who don't dismiss it | Dynamic positioning: feedback button detects banner state via localStorage + custom event |
| Google search link not recognizable (generic ExternalLink icon) | Replaced with branded navy Google "G" SVG, hidden by default, visible on row hover |
| Expand chevron gap too wide from recipient name | Reduced expand column 40→32px, tighter cell padding (px-1) |
| Google G icon cluttering every row at rest | Hidden by default (opacity-0), appears on row hover (60%), full on direct hover |

## Next Steps

1. Homepage copy optimization (remaining value props — "doel door doen" principle)
2. M1.0 Launch Gate items: SEO, rate limiting, user migration, DNS plan
3. Test remaining search-scoped edge cases (combined search + filter, cross-module counts)
