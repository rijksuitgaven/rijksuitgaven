# Daily Log - 2026-01-30

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V1.0 Development
**Sprint:** Week 6 - User Auth (paused for roadmap work)
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours

---

## Summary

Strategic planning session focused on establishing clear versioning structure and product roadmap. Reviewed pitch decks, established V1-V7 versioning scheme, added Rijksnetwerken (V6) as new major version, conducted infrastructure architecture review, and created tracking documents for product tiers, audiences, and infrastructure requirements.

**Key outcome:** Clear roadmap from V1 (Search Platform) through V7 (European Platform) with documented infrastructure needs per version.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Versioning Structure Overhaul

Reviewed pitch deck and identified confusion between V1.0, V1.1, V2.0 labels. Established clear versioning scheme:

**Major versions = New capabilities / new use cases:**

| Version | Name | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| V1 | Search Platform | "Who received money?" |
| V2 | Theme Discovery | "What's happening in defensie?" |
| V3 | AI Research Mode | "Help me investigate this" |
| V4 | Research Workspace | "Build a case, share with team" |
| V5 | External Integrations | "What law governs this?" |
| V6 | Network Analysis | "Who runs these organizations?" |
| V7 | European Platform | "Compare NL with Germany" |

**Version scheme:**
- X.0 = Major release (new capability)
- X.Y = Minor release (improvements within major)
- X.Y.Z = Patch release (bug fixes)

**Key insight from brainstorm:** Theme landing pages (V2) serve BOTH hunters (quick entry point) AND mainstream users (ready-made insights).

### 2. Rijksnetwerken Added as V6

Based on pitch-deck-inspiration-future.pdf, added Network Analysis (Rijksnetwerken) as V6:

**Features:**
- KvK integration (board members, directors)
- Address clustering
- Network visualization
- PEP flagging
- Overlap detection

**Business model:**
- Target: Banks, insurers, accountants (40-60 organizations)
- Pricing: €25,000-€100,000+/year
- Conservative ARR potential: €1.1M

**Key decision:** Planned as upsell module (like Research Mode), not separate product.

### 3. Infrastructure Architecture Review

Senior SaaS Architect review of current vs planned infrastructure:

**Current state (V1):** Solid and production-ready
- Supabase Pro, Next.js, FastAPI, Typesense all deployed
- Performance targets met (<25ms search, 114-989ms API)

**Gaps identified (not blocking V1):**
- Redis: Not deployed (needed for V3 AI caching)
- Worker service: Not deployed (manual sync acceptable for V1)
- V2+ database tables: Not created (YAGNI - create when needed)

**Decision:** Only create things when required. Created tracking document for future needs.

### 4. Product Strategy Documents

Created planning documents for future discussion:
- Product tiers with pricing strategy
- Target audiences with personas
- Infrastructure requirements per version

   - Protected routes

2. **Overzicht Page**
   - Module totals with year columns
   - Sub-source drill-down

3. **Beta Testing Prep** (Week 8)
   - 5 beta testers
   - Final polish

- All versioning documentation is now in place
- Infrastructure review complete - no blockers for V1 launch
- Product tiers and audiences docs are drafts for future discussion

**Session Status:** Completed

## Session 2 - Evening (Dynamic Column Selection)

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours

### Work Completed

#### 1. Dynamic Column Selection (UX-005)

Implemented user-selectable columns for the DataTable. Users can now choose up to 2 additional columns to display between the primary column (Ontvanger) and the year columns.

**Backend changes:**
- Added `extra_columns` configuration to MODULE_CONFIG for each module
- Added `columns` parameter to `get_module_data()` function
- Uses `MODE() WITHIN GROUP` SQL aggregation to get most frequent value per group
- Returns `extra_columns: {"regeling": "value", "instrument": "value"}` in response
- Validated columns against allowed list per module (security)

**Frontend changes:**
- Updated `ApiRecipientRow` and `RecipientRow` types with `extraColumns` field
- Updated `ModuleQueryParams` to include `columns?: string[]`
- ColumnSelector now enforces max 2 columns with visual warning
- State lifted from DataTable to ModulePage for API integration
- DataTable renders dynamic columns after primary, before years
- CSV and XLS exports include selected columns

**Column defaults per module:**
| Module | Default Columns |
|--------|-----------------|
| Instrumenten | Regeling, Instrument |
| Apparaat | Begrotingsnaam, Detail |
| Inkoop | Ministerie, Categorie |
| Provincie | Provincie, Omschrijving |
| Gemeente | Gemeente, Omschrijving |
| Publiek | Organisatie, Regeling |
| Integraal | (none - modules shown inline) |

**Status:** Frontend complete, backend needs deployment to Railway

#### 2. CSS Fix: Warning Background Color

Added `--warning-bg` CSS variable for proper brand-compliant warning backgrounds:
```css
--warning-bg: rgba(255, 200, 87, 0.15);
```

#### 3. Header Section Labels (Experimental)

Tested different styles for ONTVANGERS/KOSTEN section labels:
- Tried light blue (#8DBADC) background
- Tried navy medium (#436FA3) with white text
- **Reverted to original gray-light style** (needs more design work)
