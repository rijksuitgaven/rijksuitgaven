## Work Completed

### 1. Versioning Structure Overhaul

Reviewed pitch deck and identified confusion between V1.0, V1.1, V2.0 labels. Established clear versioning scheme:

**Major versions = New capabilities / new use cases:**

| Version | Name | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| V1 | Search Platform | "Who received money?" |
| V2 | Theme Discovery | "What's happening in defensie?" |
| V3 | AI Research Mode | "Help me investigate this" |
| V4 | Research Workspace | "Build a case, share with team" |
| V5 | External Integrations | "What law governs this?" |
| V6 | European Platform | "Compare NL with Germany" |

**Version scheme:**
- X.0 = Major release (new capability)
- X.Y = Minor release (improvements within major)
- X.Y.Z = Patch release (bug fixes)

**Key insight from brainstorm:** Theme landing pages (V2) serve BOTH hunters (quick entry point) AND mainstream users (ready-made insights). This was missing from the V2 vision doc.

### 2. Rijksnetwerken Added as V6

Based on pitch-deck-inspiration-future.pdf, added Network Analysis (Rijksnetwerken) as V6:

**Features:**
- KvK integration (board members, directors)
- Address clustering
- Network visualization
- PEP flagging
- Overlap detection

**Business model:**
- Target: Banks, insurers, accountants (40-60 organizations)
- Pricing: €25,000-€100,000+/year
- Conservative ARR potential: €1.1M

**Key decision:** Planned as upsell module (like Research Mode), not separate product.

### 3. Documentation Updates
