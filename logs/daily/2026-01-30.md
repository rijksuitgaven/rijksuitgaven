# Daily Log - 2026-01-30

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V1.0 Development
**Sprint:** Week 6 - User Auth (paused for roadmap work)
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours

---

## Summary

Strategic planning session focused on establishing clear versioning structure and product roadmap. Reviewed pitch decks, established V1-V7 versioning scheme, added Rijksnetwerken (V6) as new major version, conducted infrastructure architecture review, and created tracking documents for product tiers, audiences, and infrastructure requirements.

**Key outcome:** Clear roadmap from V1 (Search Platform) through V7 (European Platform) with documented infrastructure needs per version.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Versioning Structure Overhaul

Reviewed pitch deck and identified confusion between V1.0, V1.1, V2.0 labels. Established clear versioning scheme:

**Major versions = New capabilities / new use cases:**

| Version | Name | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| V1 | Search Platform | "Who received money?" |
| V2 | Theme Discovery | "What's happening in defensie?" |
| V3 | AI Research Mode | "Help me investigate this" |
| V4 | Research Workspace | "Build a case, share with team" |
| V5 | External Integrations | "What law governs this?" |
| V6 | Network Analysis | "Who runs these organizations?" |
| V7 | European Platform | "Compare NL with Germany" |

**Version scheme:**
- X.0 = Major release (new capability)
- X.Y = Minor release (improvements within major)
- X.Y.Z = Patch release (bug fixes)

**Key insight from brainstorm:** Theme landing pages (V2) serve BOTH hunters (quick entry point) AND mainstream users (ready-made insights).

### 2. Rijksnetwerken Added as V6

Based on pitch-deck-inspiration-future.pdf, added Network Analysis (Rijksnetwerken) as V6:

**Features:**
- KvK integration (board members, directors)
- Address clustering
- Network visualization
- PEP flagging
- Overlap detection

**Business model:**
- Target: Banks, insurers, accountants (40-60 organizations)
- Pricing: €25,000-€100,000+/year
- Conservative ARR potential: €1.1M

**Key decision:** Planned as upsell module (like Research Mode), not separate product.

### 3. Infrastructure Architecture Review

Senior SaaS Architect review of current vs planned infrastructure:

**Current state (V1):** Solid and production-ready
- Supabase Pro, Next.js, FastAPI, Typesense all deployed
- Performance targets met (<25ms search, 114-989ms API)

**Gaps identified (not blocking V1):**
- Redis: Not deployed (needed for V3 AI caching)
- Worker service: Not deployed (manual sync acceptable for V1)
- V2+ database tables: Not created (YAGNI - create when needed)

**Decision:** Only create things when required. Created tracking document for future needs.

### 4. Product Strategy Documents

Created planning documents for future discussion:
- Product tiers with pricing strategy
- Target audiences with personas
- Infrastructure requirements per version

## Session 2 - Evening (Dynamic Column Selection)

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours

### Work Completed

#### 1. Dynamic Column Selection (UX-005)

Implemented user-selectable columns for the DataTable. Users can now choose up to 2 additional columns to display between the primary column (Ontvanger) and the year columns.

**Backend changes:**
- Added `extra_columns` configuration to MODULE_CONFIG for each module
- Added `columns` parameter to `get_module_data()` function
- Uses `MODE() WITHIN GROUP` SQL aggregation to get most frequent value per group
- Returns `extra_columns: {"regeling": "value", "instrument": "value"}` in response
- Validated columns against allowed list per module (security)

**Frontend changes:**
- Updated `ApiRecipientRow` and `RecipientRow` types with `extraColumns` field
- Updated `ModuleQueryParams` to include `columns?: string[]`
- ColumnSelector now enforces max 2 columns with visual warning
- State lifted from DataTable to ModulePage for API integration
- DataTable renders dynamic columns after primary, before years
- CSV and XLS exports include selected columns

**Column defaults per module:**
| Module | Default Columns |
|--------|-----------------|
| Instrumenten | Regeling, Instrument |
| Apparaat | Begrotingsnaam, Detail |
| Inkoop | Ministerie, Categorie |
| Provincie | Provincie, Omschrijving |
| Gemeente | Gemeente, Omschrijving |
| Publiek | Organisatie, Regeling |
| Integraal | (none - modules shown inline) |

**Status:** Frontend complete, backend needs deployment to Railway

#### 2. CSS Fix: Warning Background Color

Added `--warning-bg` CSS variable for proper brand-compliant warning backgrounds:
```css
--warning-bg: rgba(255, 200, 87, 0.15);
```

#### 3. Header Section Labels (Experimental)

Tested different styles for ONTVANGERS/KOSTEN section labels:
- Tried light blue (#8DBADC) background
- Tried navy medium (#436FA3) with white text
- **Reverted to original gray-light style** (needs more design work)

---

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/modules.py` | Added extra_columns config, MODE() aggregation |
| `backend/app/api/v1/modules.py` | Added columns parameter to endpoint |
| `app/src/types/api.ts` | Added extraColumns to types |
| `app/src/lib/api.ts` | Transform extra_columns from API |
| `app/src/components/column-selector/column-selector.tsx` | Max 2 enforcement, updated defaults |
| `app/src/components/module-page/module-page.tsx` | Lifted selectedColumns state |
| `app/src/components/data-table/data-table.tsx` | Render dynamic columns, export support |
| `app/src/app/globals.css` | Added --warning-bg variable |
| `app/src/components/header/header.tsx` | Reverted experimental changes |

---

### Pending

- **Backend deployment**: Changes need to be pushed to Railway for columns to work
- **Header redesign**: Section labels need proper design exploration

---

**Session 2 Status:** Documentation complete, ready for commit

## Session 3 - Dynamic Match Column (UX Enhancement)

**Context:** User feedback highlighted UX issue where search terms might not appear in displayed columns. Users searching for "regeling" values would see results but not understand why those recipients matched.

### Work Completed

#### 1. Dynamic "Match" Column for Search Results

Implemented smart column display that adapts based on context:
- **When NOT searching:** Shows user-selected extra columns (default columns when none selected)
- **When searching:** Shows a single "Match" column with format "Field: Value" showing which field matched the search

**Backend changes:**
- Modified `_get_from_source_table()` to detect which field matched the search
- Added SQL pattern: `MAX(CASE WHEN field ILIKE $1 THEN field END) AS matched_field`
- Returns `matched_field` and `matched_value` in API response when searching
- Works with Dutch language rules (regex patterns for -ie suffix words)

**Frontend changes:**
- Added `matched_field` and `matched_value` to `ApiRecipientRow` and `RecipientRow` types
- Added `searchQuery` prop to DataTable component
- DataTable shows "Match" column when `searchQuery` is present
- Match column displays: "Field: Value" with field label in medium weight
- Field labels mapped to Dutch (e.g., "regeling" → "Regeling")

**API Response Example (when searching):**
```json
{
  "primary_value": "ProRail B.V.",
  "matched_field": "regeling",
  "matched_value": "Beheerconcessie Hoofdrailnet",
  "years": {...},
  "totaal": 1234567890
}
```

**UX Flow:**
1. User loads module → sees default columns (if any) or just primary + years
2. User searches "beheerconcessie" → Match column appears showing which field matched
3. User clears search → Match column disappears, default columns return

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `backend/app/services/modules.py` | Search-aware column selection, matched_field detection |
| `backend/app/api/v1/modules.py` | Added matched_field/matched_value to AggregatedRow model |
| `app/src/types/api.ts` | Added matchedField/matchedValue to types |
| `app/src/lib/api.ts` | Transform matched_field from API |
| `app/src/components/data-table/data-table.tsx` | Dynamic Match column, field labels |
| `app/src/components/module-page/module-page.tsx` | Pass searchQuery to DataTable |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Match column vs static columns | Dynamic: show Match when searching, static when not |
| Match column format | "Field: Value" with field label bolded |
| Field priority | Check fields in search_fields order, skip primary (already shown) |
| Export behavior | Exports use static columns (not search-specific Match) |

**Session 3 Status:** Implementation complete, ready for commit
