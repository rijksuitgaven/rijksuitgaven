# Daily Log - 2026-02-09

**Project:** Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Migration
**Phase:** V1.0 Development
**Sprint:** V1 Feature Close Review + Week 6 Preparation
**Session Duration:** [to be filled]

## Summary

Three improvements: (1) UX-023 — Custom GroupingSelect dropdown with counts in expanded row, replacing native `<select>` with styled dropdown matching filter panel design. Full-stack: backend endpoint + BFF + frontend component. (2) Autocomplete performance — reduced debounce 150ms→50ms, parallelized all Typesense calls via asyncio.gather (5 sequential calls → 1 parallel batch). Perceived latency ~330ms→~110ms. (3) Typesense data enrichment (moved from V1.1 to V1.0) — enriched recipients collection with year amounts (y2016-y2024), years_with_data, record_count. Integraal search now uses Typesense hybrid pattern (~100-150ms warm, was ~200ms regex).

## Work Completed

### Session 1: UX-023 — GroupingSelect Dropdown with Counts

**Full-stack implementation:**

1. **Backend service** (`services/modules.py`): Added `GROUPABLE_FIELDS` dict and `get_grouping_counts()` async function — single SQL query with `COUNT(DISTINCT field)` per groupable field
2. **Backend API** (`api/v1/modules.py`): New `GET /{module}/{primary_value}/grouping-counts` endpoint, returns `dict[str, int]`
3. **BFF proxy** (`grouping-counts/route.ts`): New Next.js API route proxying to backend
4. **Frontend** (`expanded-row.tsx`): `GroupingSelect` component replacing native `<select>` — custom single-select dropdown with counts, checkmark on selected, chevron rotation, click-outside/escape-to-close

**Styling iterations:**
- Initial: `border-[var(--border)]` (too invisible on gray background)
- v2: `border-[var(--navy-medium)]/40` (too prominent when open)
- v3: `border-[var(--muted-foreground)]/30` (still not visible enough in closed state)
- v4: `border-[var(--border)]` exact match (still invisible)
- **Final: `border-[var(--muted-foreground)]`** — same `#436FA3` color as tree connectors (`├` `└`), creating visual cohesion

**Deployed to production** via Railway auto-deploy.

### Session 2: Autocomplete Performance Optimization

**Analysis:** Expert team investigation identified two bottlenecks:
1. **Debounce too high** — 150ms delay before any request fires (half the perceived latency)
2. **Sequential Typesense calls** — 5 serial network round-trips (~220ms) when all are independent

**Changes:**
1. **Debounce 150ms → 50ms** — saves ~100ms perceived latency. AbortController prevents request pile-up.
2. **Module autocomplete parallelized** — primary search + 3 field searches + recipients search all fire via `asyncio.gather()`, results processed sequentially after
3. **Global autocomplete parallelized** — `search_recipients()` + `search_keywords()` run via `asyncio.gather()`. Inside `search_keywords()`, 4 collection searches also parallelized.

**Results:** ~55% faster perceived autocomplete (330ms → ~110ms estimated).

**Deployed to production** via Railway auto-deploy.

### Session 3: Typesense Data Enrichment (Moved V1.1 → V1.0)

**Analysis:** Adversarial strategist team evaluated two Typesense improvements:
1. **Typesense data enrichment** — Store year amounts in recipients collection so integraal uses Typesense hybrid search instead of regex → **FEASIBLE, implemented**
2. **Typesense facets for cascading filters** — Use Typesense faceting for filter dropdowns → **NOT FEASIBLE** (Typesense collections are per-module with different schemas, facets can't replace PostgreSQL DISTINCT on source tables)

**Changes:**

1. **Typesense schema** (`collections.json`): Added 11 fields to recipients collection — y2016-y2024 (int64, optional), years_with_data (int32, facet), record_count (int32)
2. **Sync script** (`sync_to_typesense.py`): Updated SQL to include COALESCE year columns from universal_search view, updated document mapping
3. **Backend** (`services/modules.py`): New `_typesense_search_recipient_keys()` helper — searches recipients collection, returns ontvanger_key IDs with word-boundary filtering. Modified `get_integraal_data()` to use Typesense hybrid search (WHERE ontvanger_key = ANY($1)) with regex fallback.

**Re-sync:** Recipients collection re-synced on production — 463,731 documents with enriched data. All 7 collections pass audit (exact match with PostgreSQL).

**Production timing (warm):**

| Query | `elapsed_ms` |
|-------|-------------|
| prorail | 115ms |
| amsterdam | 152ms |
| shell | 99ms |
| klm | 97ms |

Improvement: ~50-100ms faster than regex baseline (~200ms).

**Deployed to production** via Railway auto-deploy.

### Session 4: UX-024 Requirement + Newsletter + Marketing Folder + Tooling

**Work completed (continuation session):**

1. **Expert team review of remaining optimization suggestions** — Investigated 4 quick wins from previous expert team. Concluded: per_page reduction (outdated/wrong), HTTP/2 (marginal), query caching (premature), prefetch on focus (deferred to V1.1). None worth doing now.

2. **UX-024: Type-ahead with Recent Searches** — Brainstormed Google-like type-ahead behavior. Wrote formal requirement in `search-requirements.md`: localStorage recent searches on focus, reduced debounce (50ms→30ms), client-side response caching (5min TTL). Planned for V1.1, ~2-3 hours effort. Updated `VERSIONING.md` V1.1 entry.

3. **Beta announcement newsletter** — Assembled 4-person expert team (copywriter, domain expert, conversion strategist, adversarial strategist). Created newsletter for current WordPress subscribers (~50 users) to generate beta sign-ups. Two revision rounds: corrected factual errors (Integraal already existed, detail-page-tabs pain point missed), changed pronouns je→u. Final subject: "Het nieuwe Rijksuitgaven is bijna klaar - word bètatester".

4. **Marketing folder structure** — Created `10-marketing/` with `newsletters/` and `campaigns/` subfolders. Saved newsletter and README with tone-of-voice guidelines.

5. **GitHub Projects evaluation** — Assembled expert team to evaluate visual project tracking. Recommendation: GitHub Projects as lightweight dashboard (Issues = pointers to markdown specs). Decision: deferred to V1.2 backlog — current markdown system works, tool adds maintenance overhead for 2-person team.

6. **CLAUDE.md UX tracker** — Updated next available UX number to UX-025.
