## Work Completed

### 1. Added Golden Rules to CLAUDE.md

Reinforced three non-negotiable behaviors that must be automatic:

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Requirements Check** | Before ANY proposal, verify against V1 and V2 requirements |
| **Documentation Sync** | After ANY change, immediately update all affected docs |
| **Ask, Don't Assume** | When in doubt, stop and ask - never guess |

These rules now appear at the top of CLAUDE.md and override all other rules.

### 2. Frontend Code Review & Security Fixes

Comprehensive code review of all frontend components. Fixed critical and high-priority issues.

#### Critical Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **Typesense API key exposed in client code** | Created backend proxy (`/api/v1/search/autocomplete`), moved all Typesense calls server-side |
| **XSS risk in CSV filename** | Added filename sanitization: `replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_.]/g, '')` |
| **console.error leaking data** | Removed error logging that could expose sensitive data |

#### High/Medium Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| TypeScript `any` types | Added proper `Column<RecipientRow>` and `ColumnMeta` types |
| Header dropdown fragile blur pattern | Replaced with proper `useEffect` for click-outside and Escape key |
| API_BASE_URL duplicated 5 times | Created centralized `lib/api-config.ts`, updated all imports |

---

## Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `backend/app/api/v1/search.py` | Typesense proxy endpoint - keeps API key server-side |
| `app/src/lib/api-config.ts` | Centralized API base URL configuration |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Added "Golden Rules" section |
| `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` | Added search router import |
| `app/src/components/search-bar/search-bar.tsx` | Use backend proxy instead of direct Typesense calls |
| `app/src/components/detail-panel/detail-panel.tsx` | Sanitized filename, removed console.error |
| `app/src/components/data-table/data-table.tsx` | Fixed TypeScript types (Column, ColumnMeta) |
| `app/src/components/header/header.tsx` | Fixed dropdown: Escape key + click-outside handling |
| `app/src/components/data-table/expanded-row.tsx` | Use centralized API config |
| `app/src/components/cross-module-results/cross-module-results.tsx` | Use centralized API config |
| `app/src/lib/api.ts` | Use centralized API config |

---

## Issues Resolved

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Typesense API key exposed | Backend proxy, key stays server-side only |
| XSS risk in CSV download | Filename sanitization |
| TypeScript `any` usage | Proper typing with Column and ColumnMeta |
| Header dropdown UX bugs | Proper event handlers for Escape and click-outside |
| Duplicated API_BASE_URL | Centralized config file |
